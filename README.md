📱 Internet Speed Test App
An advanced Internet Speed Test app built using Flutter, designed for a precise and visually engaging measurement of network speed. This app is tailored for users and developers looking for a beautiful, real-time speed analysis tool with features suited for both casual use and network diagnostics.

🌟 Features
Comprehensive Speed Analysis

📉 Download and Upload Speeds: Accurately measure data rates for both directions.
🕒 Ping and Jitter Measurement: Evaluate network responsiveness and stability.
📊 Latency Monitoring: Real-time updates on network latency for smoother diagnostics.
Dynamic Graph Visualization

Real-Time Graphs: Download and upload speed data plotted on live graphs, with customizable Y-axis and X-axis scales.
Smooth Animations: Intuitive graph animations for easy readability of speed variations.
Elegant, Modern UI

🌐 Glassmorphism Design: A visually striking, glass-effect interface with shadows, borders, and gradient highlights.
📱 Responsive Layout: Clean and adaptive UI designed for various screen sizes, ensuring consistent aesthetics across devices.
User-Centric Functionality

🚀 One-Tap Speed Test: Quick and easy speed test initiation with a clear display of results.
🧩 Detailed Stats: Provides download, upload, ping, and jitter results in an organized layout.
🛠 Tech Stack
Framework: Flutter
Libraries:
fl_chart: For rendering smooth and interactive graphs.
syncfusion_flutter_gauges: Displays speed metrics in a gauge-style format.
blur: Adds a blurred, glass effect to various UI elements.
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the app on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK (version 3.x or higher)
Dart SDK
Git (to clone the repository)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash

flutter run
📐 Project Structure
lib/: Contains the main Flutter codebase.

main.dart: Entry point of the application.
speed_test_screen.dart: Main UI for the speed test screen, including gauge, graph, and start button logic.
components/: Reusable components for different parts of the UI, such as graph card, metrics card, and start button.
models/: Data models used to store and retrieve test results and analytics.
utils/: Utility functions for handling data formatting and speed calculations.
assets/: Placeholder for app assets like icons, images, and font files.

📊 How It Works
Initiate Speed Test

A single tap on the "Start Test" button triggers simulated network data generation for download and upload speeds, ping, and jitter.
Data Visualization

Download and upload speeds are plotted dynamically on the graph. X and Y axes provide reference values, making it easy to interpret the data visually.
A radial gauge displays the download speed in real-time, giving users immediate feedback.
Test Results

Upon completion, results are displayed on cards with metrics for download, upload, ping, and jitter. Each metric is color-coded and styled for quick reference.
🧩 Customization & Configuration
Color and Themes: The app uses a sleek, glass-effect theme, but the color scheme and gradient settings in speed_test_screen.dart can be customized.
Graph Settings: Modify the fl_chart settings in the buildGraph() function for alternative graph styles or additional data points.
Metric Display: Customize the display format in buildGlassMetricCard and buildGlassSpeedCard to show more detailed data if desired.
